# AppGrid API

This document describes the AppGrid RESTful API, a powerful and lightweight read-only API which
feeds applications with configuration- and content parameters configured from the AppGrid Admin UI.

## Session Management [/session{?appKey}{?uuid}]

This method is a starting point for any communication with AppGrid APIs and is used to generate a
session key. A session could be created either by passing parameters via query string or headers. If the
header approach is chosen, both X-Application-Key and X-User-Id HTTP headers must be provided.

<b>Note:</b> AppGrid does not support mixing of header and query string parameters for this method.
Application should keep track of the session expiration time and either re-create the session when itâ€™s
about to expire, or handle session response about invalid/expired session.
